This financial analytics dashboard remains in early stages of 
development.  Equity and index data are currently sourced from
Yahoo, however there are plans to incorporate a breadth of symbols
from such asset classes as futures, currencies, and fixed income.  
Additionally, current work focuses on the options section which was 
the primary impetus for this dashboard.  

Features for the Options section will include:
 - 2D and 3D analyses of first and second order greeks 
 - Smart stratgegy creation constrained to user defined parameters
 - What-if calculations
 - Historical analytics (if available)

The last section will be an ambitious attempt to include
trajectory simulation and deep learning-based time series analysis.
Extracting only a slight edge from this analysis may prove quite
valuable in conjunction with options analytics.

Of lesser importance will be cosmetic enhancements consisting of
an improved UI with interactive charting and further
customization.
